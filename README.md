# LeetCoach

An AI-powered LeetCode companion that analyzes your solutions in real time, asks Socratic follow-up questions when you can do better, and schedules problems for spaced repetition review so you actually retain what you learn.

Built with a Chrome extension (MV3), a React web dashboard, three AWS Lambda functions, and Claude AI.

## Features

- **Automatic submission detection** — hooks into LeetCode's fetch/XHR pipeline without requiring any manual action
- **AI complexity analysis** — Claude identifies your time and space complexity, compares it to the optimal, and scores how close you were
- **Socratic hints** — instead of just telling you the answer, LeetCoach asks targeted follow-up questions to push your thinking
- **Spaced repetition (SM-2)** — every accepted submission is scheduled for future review based on how well you solved it; the harder the problem, the sooner it comes back
- **Web dashboard** — full submission history, topic breakdown, current streak, and a review queue at [leetcoach.app](https://leetcoach.app)
- **Synced auth** — sign in once via the extension; the same Cognito session works on the website

AI (Claude via Anthropic API)

      · Socratic follow-up questions
      · One actionable hint
      · Algorithm topics and pattern name
```

## How It Works

### 1. Submission Detection

`injected.js` runs in the real page context and monkey-patches `window.fetch` and `XMLHttpRequest` to intercept two LeetCode network calls:

- The GraphQL `submitV2` mutation — captures the `submission_id`
- The `/submissions/detail/:id/check/` polling endpoint — captures the result once judging completes

Results are forwarded via `postMessage` to `content.js`, which passes them to the background service worker.

### 2. AI Analysis

`background.js` sends the code and metadata to `POST /submissions/analyze`. The Lambda builds a structured prompt and calls Claude, asking for:

- Your time/space complexity vs. the known optimal
- An optimality score from 0 to 1
- Whether the solution is fully optimal
- 2–3 Socratic follow-up questions (only if suboptimal)
- One concrete hint
- Relevant algorithm topics

The response is rendered as an overlay panel on the LeetCode page within a few seconds of submission.

### 3. Spaced Repetition (SM-2)

Every submission updates a DynamoDB SRS record using the SM-2 algorithm. The `optimalityScore` from Claude is mapped to a quality rating:

| Optimality | SM-2 Quality | Meaning |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| ≥ 0.90 | 5 | Perfect recall |
| ≥ 0.75 | 4 | Good |
| ≥ 0.50 | 3 | Correct with effort |
| ≥ 0.25 | 2 | Familiar but incorrect |
| < 0.25 | 1 | Barely remembered |

The `nextReview` date is stored and indexed in a GSI so the review queue can be queried efficiently with a single DynamoDB call.

### 4. Review Queue

The website's `/review` page fetches all SRS items due today or earlier, presents each problem one at a time, and lets you rate your recall. Ratings update the SM-2 record and push `nextReview` into the future — easy problems come back in weeks, hard ones tomorrow.

## DynamoDB Schema

Single table `leetcoach` with three item types:

| Item | PK | SK | Notes |
|------|----|----|-------|
| User profile | `USER#<userId>` | `PROFILE` | |
| Submission | `USER#<userId>` | `SUB#<iso-ts>#<slug>` | Sorted by time descending |
| SRS record | `USER#<userId>` | `SRS#<slug>` | One per problem |

**GSI1** on SRS records: `GSI1PK = SRS#<userId>`, `GSI1SK = <nextReview ISO>` — enables `GSI1SK <= now` range query for the review queue.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+
- AWS CLI configured (`aws configure`)
- AWS CDK installed (`npm install -g aws-cdk`)
- An [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com)

### 1. Deploy the Backend

```bash
cd infrastructure
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Add your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and WEBSITE_URL to .env

npx cdk bootstrap   # first time only
npm run deploy
```

Note the outputs — you'll need them for the next two steps:

```
LeetCoachStack.ApiUrl            = https://xxxxxxxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/
LeetCoachStack.UserPoolId        = us-east-1_XXXXXXXXX
LeetCoachStack.UserPoolClientId  = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

### 2. Set Up the Website

```bash
cd website
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
# Fill in VITE_API_URL, VITE_USER_POOL_ID, VITE_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID, VITE_AWS_REGION

npm run dev       # http://localhost:5173
npm run build     # production build → dist/
```

### 3. Build the Chrome Extension

```bash
cd extension

export API_URL=https://xxxxxxxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod
export USER_POOL_ID=us-east-1_XXXXXXXXX
export CLIENT_ID=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

./build.sh
```

Then load it in Chrome:

1. Go to `chrome://extensions`
2. Enable **Developer mode** (top right toggle)
3. Click **Load unpacked** → select `extension/dist/`

## Development

**Extension** — edit files in `extension/src/`, run `./build.sh`, then click the reload icon on `chrome://extensions`. No hot reload, but the build takes under a second.

**Website** — `npm run dev` in `website/` for Vite HMR.

**Backend** — edit Lambda source in `backend/`, then redeploy from `infrastructure/` with `npm run deploy`. CDK only updates functions whose source changed.

**Infrastructure changes** — edit `infrastructure/lib/leetcoach-stack.ts` and run `npm run diff` first to preview changes before deploying.
